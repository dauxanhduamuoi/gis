<p>
The vast park surrounding the summer residence of the last Polish
king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, is where Varsovians like to go
for longer walks. The park is home to a winter garden, an
amphitheatre, and even a Chinese garden. The biggest attraction,
however, is the park’s permanent residents: the squirrels and
peacocks. Another site worth seeing is the classicistic Palace on
the Isle with its enchanting interior design and gallery of
paintings.
</p>
<p>
The park is famous for its Chopin concerts, which take place from
mid-May to the end of September every Sunday at noon and 4 pm. Come
lounge on the grass and enjoy the music.

<p>
The Royal Route connects three former residences of Polish rulers:
Royal Castle, Royal Łazienki and Wilanów Palace. It is the city’s
most famous route. Among the buildings lining the streets Krakowskie
Przedmieście and Nowy Świat are the Presidential Palace, the Warsaw
University campus, as well as beautiful churches and townhouses. The
Route continues along the elegant and green Aleje Ujazdowskie, with
embassies and ministries situated along the way. The historical
route ends at Wilanów Palace. The Route is not to be missed in the
wintertime when it is illuminated with thousands of lights as part
of the Great Illumination.

<p>
A UNESCO world heritage site, the Old Town charms with its colourful
townhouses and the exceptional atmosphere of its narrow streets.
When in the Old Town Market Square, you will meet a mermaid – the
official symbol of the city. Don’t forget to see the Barbican, stop
by the bell on Kanonia Street, and walk along the old city walls.
You should also visit the Royal Castle. Apart from the royal
apartments, the old seat of Polish rulers also houses an art
collection with paintings by Rembrandt and Bernardo Bellotto, also
known as Canaletto.

<p>
Wilanów Palace is a true pearl of Baroque architecture in Warsaw.
Learn about King Jan III Sobieski, who successfully fended off the
Turks in the battle of Vienna and who lived in Wilanów with his
beloved Marysieńka. Take a walk in the park and tour the palace
interiors; see the portrait gallery and listen to stories of great
romances. The building and the park have both kept their original
form, despite the partition, war, and occupation. Wilanów Palace is
a must-see when visiting Warsaw. In the wintertime, the venue,
illuminated with thousands of lamps, transforms into the Royal
Garden of Lights.
